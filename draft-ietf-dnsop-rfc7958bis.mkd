--- abstract

The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) is
cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the DNS using
DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable trust anchor. 
This document describes the format and publication mechanisms IANA uses to distribute the DNSSEC trust anchors.

This document obsoletes RFC 7958.

# Introduction

The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in {{RFC1034}} and {{RFC1035}}.
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are described in {{RFC9364}}.

In the DNSSEC protocol, Resource Record Sets (RRSets) are signed
cryptographically.  This means that a response to a query contains
signatures that allow the integrity and authenticity of the RRSet to
be verified.  DNSSEC signatures are validated by following a chain of
signatures to a "trust anchor".  The reason for trusting a trust
anchor is outside the DNSSEC protocol, but having one or more trust
anchors is required for the DNSSEC protocol to work.

The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
IANA function performed by ICANN, through its affiliate Public Technical Identifiers (PTI). A detailed description of
corresponding key management practices can be found in {{DPS}}.

This document describes the formats and distribution methods of
DNSSEC trust anchors that have been used by IANA for the root zone of
the DNS since 2010.  Other organizations might have different formats
and mechanisms for distributing DNSSEC trust anchors for the root
zone; however, most operators and software vendors have chosen to
rely on the IANA trust anchors.

The formats and distribution methods described in this document are a
complement to, not a substitute for, the automated DNSSEC trust
anchor update protocol described in {{RFC5011}}.  That protocol allows
for secure in-band succession of trust anchors when trust has already
been established.  This document describes one way to establish an
initial trust anchor that can be used by RFC 5011.

This document obsoletes {{RFC7958}}.

## Definitions

The term "trust anchor" is used in many different contexts in the
security community.  Many of the common definitions conflict because
they are specific to a specific system, such as just for DNSSEC or
just for S/MIME messages.

In cryptographic systems with hierarchical structure, a trust anchor
is an authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and not
derived.  The format of the entity differs in different systems, but
the basic idea, that trust is assumed and not derived, is common to
all the common uses of the term "trust anchor".

The root zone trust anchor formats published by IANA are defined in
{{ta_formats}}.  {{RFC4033}} defines a trust anchor as "A configured DNSKEY
RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR".  Note that the formats defined here
do not match the definition of "trust anchor" from {{RFC4033}};
however, a system that wants to convert the trusted material from
IANA into a Delegation Signer (DS) RR can do so.

## Changes from RFC 7958

This version of the document includes the following changes:

- There is a signficant technical change from erratum 5932 &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5932&gt;.
This is in the seventh paragraph of {{xml_semantics}}.

- Added the optional public key element.

- Removed the certificates and certificate signing mechanisms.

- Removed the detached OpenPGP signature mechanism.

- The reference to the DNSSEC Practice Statement {{DPS}} was updated.

- Say explicitly that the XML documents might have XML comments in them.

- Added an IANA Considerations section.

- There was a bit of editorial cleanup.

# IANA DNSSEC Root Zone Trust Anchor Format and Semantics {#ta_formats}

IANA publishes trust anchors for the root zone as an XML document that contains the hashes of the DNSKEY records
and optionally the keys from the DNSKEY records.

This format and the semantics associated are described in
the rest of this section.


Note that the XML document can have XML comments.
For example, IANA might use these comments to add pointers to important information on the IANA web site.
XML comments are only used as human-readable commentary, not extensions to the grammar.

The XML document contains a set of hashes for the DNSKEY records that
can be used to validate the root zone.  The hashes are consistent
with the defined presentation format of DS resource.

The XML document also can contain the keys from the DNSKEY records.
The keys are consistent with the defined presentation format of DNSKEY resource.

Note that the hashes are mandatory in the syntax, but the keys are optional.

## XML Syntax {#xml_syntax}

A RELAX NG Compact Schema {{RELAX-NG}} for the documents used to
publish trust anchors is:

~~~
datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"

start = element TrustAnchor {
    attribute id { xsd:string },
    attribute source { xsd:string },
    element Zone { xsd:string },

    keydigest+
}

keydigest = element KeyDigest {
    attribute id { xsd:string },
    attribute validFrom { xsd:dateTime },
    attribute validUntil { xsd:dateTime }?,

    element KeyTag {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "65535" } },
    element Algorithm {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "255" } },
    element DigestType {
            xsd:nonNegativeInteger { maxInclusive = "255" } },
    element Digest { xsd:hexBinary },
    element PublicKey { xsd:base64Binary }?
}
~~~

## XML Semantics {#xml_semantics}

The TrustAnchor element is the container for all of the trust anchors
in the file.

The id attribute in the TrustAnchor element is an opaque string that
identifies the set of trust anchors.  Its value has no particular
semantics.  Note that the id element in the TrustAnchor element is
different than the id element in the KeyDigest element, described
below.

The source attribute in the TrustAnchor element gives information
about where to obtain the TrustAnchor container.  It is likely to be
a URL and is advisory only.

The Zone element in the TrustAnchor element states to which DNS zone
this container applies.  The root zone is indicated by a single
period (.) character without any quotation marks.

The TrustAnchor element contains one or more KeyDigest elements.
Each KeyDigest element represents the digest of a past, current, or
potential future DNSKEY record of the zone defined in the Zone element.

The id attribute in the KeyDigest element is an opaque string that
identifies the hash.
Note that the id element in the KeyDigest element is different than
the id element in the TrustAnchor element described above.

The validFrom and validUntil attributes in the KeyDigest element specify
the range of times that the KeyDigest element can be used as a trust anchor.
Note that the validUntil attribute of the KeyDigest element is optional.
If the relying party is using a trust anchor that has a KeyDigest element
that does not have a validUntil attribute, it can change to a trust anchor
with a KeyDigest element that does have a validUntil attribute,
as long as that trust anchor's validUntil attribute is in the future and the
DNSKEY elements of the KeyDigest are the same as the previous trust anchor.
Relying parties SHOULD NOT use a KeyDigest outside of the time range given
in the validFrom and validUntil attributes.

The KeyTag element in the KeyDigest element contains the key tag for
the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.

The Algorithm element in the KeyDigest element contains the signing
algorithm identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

The DigestType element in the KeyDigest element contains the digest
algorithm identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

The Digest element in the KeyDigest element contains the hexadecimal
representation of the hash for the DNSKEY record represented in this
KeyDigest.

The PublicKey element in the KeyDigest element contains the base64
representation of the public key represented in this KeyDigest.
The PublicKey is optional and is new in this version of the specification.

## Converting from XML to DS Records {#conversion-example}

The display format for the DS record that is the equivalent of a
KeyDigest element can be constructed by marshaling the KeyTag,
Algorithm, DigestType, and Digest elements.  For example, assume that
the TrustAnchor element contains:

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<TrustAnchor
   id="AD42165F-3B1A-4778-8F42-D34A1D41FD93"
   source="http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml">
<Zone>.</Zone>
<KeyDigest id="Kjqmt7v" validFrom="2010-07-15T00:00:00+00:00">
<KeyTag>19036</KeyTag>
<Algorithm>8</Algorithm>
<DigestType>2</DigestType>
<Digest>
49AAC11D7B6F6446702E54A1607371607A1A41855200FD2CE1CDDE32F24E8FB5
</Digest>
<PublicKey>

QxA+Uk1ihz0=
</PublicKey>
</KeyDigest>
</TrustAnchor>
~~~

The DS record would be:

~~~
. IN DS 19036 8 2
   49AAC11D7B6F6446702E54A1607371607A1A41855200FD2CE1CDDE32F24E8FB5
~~~

## Converting from XML to DNSKEY Records

The display format for the DNSKEY record that is the equivalent of a KeyDigest element can be constructed by marshaling the
Algorithm and PublicKey elements with some constants.
For example, assume that the TrustAnchor element is the same as in {{conversion-example}}.
The DNSKEY record would be:

~~~
. IN DNSKEY 257 3 8
   AwEAAagAIKlVZrpC6Ia7gEzahOR+9W29euxhJhVVLOyQbSEW0O8gcCjF
   FVQUTf6v58fLjwBd0YI0EzrAcQqBGCzh/RStIoO8g0NfnfL2MTJRkxoX
   bfDaUeVPQuYEhg37NZWAJQ9VnMVDxP/VHL496M/QZxkjf5/Efucp2gaD
   X6RS6CXpoY68LsvPVjR0ZSwzz1apAzvN9dlzEheX7ICJBBtuA6G3LQpz
   W5hOA2hzCTMjJPJ8LbqF6dsV6DoBQzgul0sGIcGOYl7OyQdXfZ57relS
   Qageu+ipAdTTJ25AsRTAoub8ONGcLmqrAmRLKBP1dfwhYB4N7knNnulq
   QxA+Uk1ihz0=   
~~~

## XML Example

The following describes two fictitious trust anchors for the root zone.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- Note that these trust anchors are fictitious. -->

<TrustAnchor
    id="AD42165F-B099-4778-8F42-D34A1D41FD93"
    source="http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml">
    <Zone>.</Zone>
    <KeyDigest id="42"
               validFrom="2010-07-01T00:00:00-00:00"
               validUntil="2010-08-01T00:00:00-00:00"> <!-- This key
    is no longer valid, since validUntil is in the past -->
        <KeyTag>34291</KeyTag>
        <Algorithm>5</Algorithm>
        <DigestType>1</DigestType>
        <Digest>c8cb3d7fe518835490af8029c23efbce6b6ef3e2</Digest>
    </KeyDigest>
    <KeyDigest id="53"
               validFrom="2010-08-01T00:00:00-00:00">

# Root Zone Trust Anchor Retrieval {#retrieving}

## Retrieving Trust Anchors with HTTPS and HTTP

Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTPS and HTTP.

In this section, all URLs are given using the "https:" scheme.  If
HTTPS cannot be used, replace the "https:" scheme with "http:".

The URL for retrieving the set of hashes in the XML file described in {{ta_formats}} is
&lt;https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml&gt;.

## Accepting DNSSEC Trust Anchors {#trusting_anchors}

A validator operator can choose whether or not to accept the trust
anchors described in this document using whatever policy they want.
In order to help validator operators verify the content and origin of
trust anchors they receive, IANA uses digital signatures that chain
to an ICANN-controlled Certificate Authority (CA) over the trust
anchor data.

It is important to note that the ICANN CA is not a DNSSEC trust
anchor.  Instead, it is an optional mechanism for verifying the
content and origin of the XML and certificate trust anchors.

The content and origin of the XML file can be verified using a
digital signature on the file.  IANA provides a detached
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) {{RFC5652}} signature that chains to
the ICANN CA with the XML file.  The URL for a detached CMS signature
for the XML file is
&lt;https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s&gt;.

Another method IANA uses to help validator operators verify the
content and origin of trust anchors they receive is to use the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for distributing the trust
anchors.  Currently, the CA used for data.iana.org is well known,
that is, one that is a WebTrust-accredited CA.  If a system
retrieving the trust anchors trusts the CA that IANA uses for the
"data.iana.org" web server, HTTPS SHOULD be used instead of HTTP in
order to have assurance of data origin.

## Changes in the Trust Model for Distribution

IANA used to distribute the trust anchors as a self-signed PGP message
and as a self-issued certificate signing request; this was described in {{RFC7958}}.
This document removes those methods because they relied on a trust model
that mixed out-of-band trust of authentication keys with out-of-band trust of the DNSSEC root keys.
Note, however, that cryptographic assurance for the contents of the trust anchor now
comes from the web PKI as described in {{trusting_anchors}}.
This cryptographic assurance is bolstered by informal comparisons made by users of the
trust anchors, such as software vendors comparing the trust anchor files they are using.

# Security Considerations

This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the root zone of
the DNS are published.  Many DNSSEC clients will only configure IANA-issued
trust anchors for the DNS root to perform validation.  As a
consequence, reliable publication of trust anchors is important.

This document aims to specify carefully the means by which such trust
anchors are published, with the goal of making it easier for those
trust anchors to be integrated into user environments.

# IANA Considerations

Each time IANA produces a new trust anchor,
it MUST publish that trust anchor using the format described in this document.

IANA MAY delay the publication of a new trust anchor for operational reasons,
such as having a newly-created key in multiple facilities.

When a trust anchor that was previously published is no longer suitable for use,
IANA MUST update the trust anchor document accordingly by setting a validUntil date for that trust anchor.
The validUntil attribute that is added MAY be a date in the past or in the future, depending on IANA's operational choices.

More information about IANA's policies and procedures for how the cryptographic keys for the DNS root zone are managed
(also known as "DNSSEC Practice Statements" or "DPSs")
can be found at <https://www.iana.org/dnssec/procedures>.

# Historical Note

The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
generated at a key ceremony at the ICANN Key Management Facility
(KMF) in Culpeper, Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key
entered production during a second key ceremony held at an
ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California, USA on 2010-07-12.
The resulting trust anchor was first published on 2010-07-15.

The second KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
generated at key ceremony #27 at the ICANN KMF in Culpeper, Virginia, USA on 2016-10-27.
This key entered production during key ceremony #28 held at
the ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California, USA on 2017-02-02.
The resulting trust anchor was first published on 2018-11-11.

More information about the key ceremonies,
including full records of previous ceremonies and plans for future ceremonies,
can be found at &lt;https://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonies&gt;.
